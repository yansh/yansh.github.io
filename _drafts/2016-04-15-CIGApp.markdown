Email and other communication platform are deeply embedded in the fabric of our
daily life. In the age of information overload it is becoming increasing hard to
keep track of all the information flows while making sure that contextual
integrity of the transmitted information is maintained. Notably, [the Hilary
Clinton email
scandal](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/read-hillary-clinton-email/)
has shown that often senior figures in the government don't really understand
the technology and its implication which can lead to information leakage. But
you don't need to a high profile case to appreciate this point, we all had
"Reply-All" incidents and forwarding need to know bits from previous
conversations.

To tackle the problem we leverage the theory of Contextual Integrity (CI) as a
framework for capturing a relevant contextual flow. In terms of CI, information
leaks are a result of altered flows which don't follow the established
information-contextual norms. CI offers a simple template comprising elements
such as *sender*, *recipients*, information *attributes*, *subject* and
*transmission principles* to make up and subsequently reason about different
informational flows. It is worth noting that the theory of contextual integrity
does not offer an explicit solution to mitigate the problem, rather it serves to
advise where the source of the controversy lies by identifying information flows
deviating from the established norms. More so, the evolution of norms, as argued
by the CI theory, requires a comprehensives analysis that includes looking at
deviating from the established/entrenched norms information flows in terms of
their *aims*, *purposes* and *values*.

> The CI decision heuristic recommends assessing [alternative flows'] respective merits as a function of the of their meaning and significance in relation to the aims, purposes, and vbalues of the context...

By Helen Nissenbaum*

Nevertheless, the CI framework, allows for an relatively straightforward way to
capture existing and hypothetical information flows by analysing the legal
policies and generating a space of possible information flows in a given context
with respect to *senders*, *receivers*, *attributes*, *subjects* and
*transmission principles*.

To showcase the practical implementation of the CI theory, we are developing a
browser extension for Gmail. The add-on that will assist users with retaining
the integrity of the information flows generated as a result of their emails.
Gmail is widely adopted email service, used by millions and source to a variety
of contextual-information flows.

CI & Emails
-----------

Our initial system prototype will be designed to leverage our CI based privacy
framework to minimize the chances of information leakage incidents. The system
will warn and in some cases prevent users from accidentally generating
information flows that might violate any of the expected privacy norms.

contexts (Personal, Educational) based on emails of the recipients and the text
of the email, roles of recipients in a particular context, etc.
</figcaption></figure>

The User Interface (UI) in traditional email clients lends itself well onto the
CI framework, namely, *Senders* and *Recipients* are explicitly specified and
form distinct and explicit information flows among themselves. The rest of the
CI elements are inferred by the system. As depicted in a screenshot in Figure 1,
our system takes full control over the compose window. To leverage the CI
framework to foresee potential privacy violations, it will extract relevant CI
elements from the emails.

In the backend, our system will use a combination of NLP and ML techniques to
determine what type of information is disseminated (*attributes*), across what
*contexts*, under which conditions (*transition principles*) and to whom (*recipients*). The resulting flow is checked against the
available privacy logic, which is derived from existing privacy policies
and/or other regulations.

In addition, our extension also monitors the information flows across all emails
in the thread. In other words, it captures all *contexts*, *senders*,
*recipients*, attributes, etc in all the messages of the thread. This allows the
backend of our system to perform complex tests using formal verification
techniques. *For example, if John writes an email to Ben, where he discusses
some personal information about Jen, who, according to the privacy policy has to
give her consent to it.* The extension will check whether an email from Jen
exists in the conversation permitting the exchange of that particular
information. The extension will notify user of any detected violations before
the email is sent.

Stay tuned!
