These are some of my thoughts on spinning out companies from a research lab.

> Disclaimer: I am not an expert. I have never spun out a company from a research lab, although I was involved in a prilimary and experimental process where I was given some time to explore comercial applications behind me research. The following post is a thought exercise based on my personal experience in a few world research labs and gut feeling of what I think will make or break the inovation process.

#Ok, I think such a disclaimer needs some context. I am currently a post doc at Princeton university, before that I spend roughly 8 months as a post doc at the Cambridge University, Computer labratory. However, before taking up a post doc position I did my PhD at the University of Sydney, supported by a scholarship National ICT Australia (NICTA).

What I am trying to say, people joining an organization (well senior people) should also agree to them. N & C were founded for promoting research,  so start-ups and everything else has piled up on top of it. So you get people, very smart people, who think they joined a research institution because they want an academic career and suddenly they are told that they need to start companies. This is not easy to process, so they fight it. I wonder, and this is a bit far fetched, if we can gather those you embrace these point (our mantra :) to found a lab. This is going to be a lab which is by itself a start-up with all the risks but also opportunities. Provide a unique PhD program where your PhD is a start-up or part of one. Huge risk, but also convince university to provide a safety net, so if things don’t work out you can defend it anyway. But before all of that find problem to solve. This is what Hugh did in Robotics lab. The lab was solving industry (mining) problems. Students getting PhDs, the lab was getting money. N & C is too big for this. You need a leaner model and grow from there. Anyway….this is something I was thinking about…

I see a lot of symmetry between doing a PhD and  start-up. Yes, the lab is not for everyone, pure academic wouldn't ' like it. This is my point, C and N are trying to lure academics. You should be up front and provide students who see benefit in it to pursue it. Otherwise, you get a PhD student and you have seen a few now, that are push into two directions, publish papers and work on a product. These are two different things, and if you are not interest in one of them the other one suffers. Larry seems to understand it in his argument on metrics. Don’t get me wrong, this new lab is much risker deal for everyone, but this is the point. People going into it should know the risks, but also rip the rewards. It would be much harder for them to get into academia, but if you pick the right people, they typically wouldn’t won’t to do it anyway.
