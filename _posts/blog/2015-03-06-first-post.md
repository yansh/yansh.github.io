This is my first post. Well not really, if you look at the github repository you will see all the attempts it took me to put out a single post. I am not dicouraged, I actually thing jykell will work well for me and will use for from now on to blog. 

If you have went through a similar migration (from blogeer to jekyll/github pages) feel free to comment on the journey.
